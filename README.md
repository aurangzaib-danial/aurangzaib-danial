### Hi ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm **Aurangzaib Danial Liaqat Khan**. However, my friends and family call me **Sunny** most of the time.  
Further, I know that I have a really long name and people some times really get amazed. 

I have recently started as an undergrad freshman at [University of Stirling](https://www.stir.ac.uk), UK.  
My major is **Computer Science** because I love programming and everything about **IoT**.

Otherthan programming, I'm crazy about binge watching **Japanese anime**.
